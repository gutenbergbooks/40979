    <h2>
      LETTER TO SIR SAMUEL SHEPHERD, KNT.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Sir,
    </h3>
    <p>
      As you have commenced the prosecution of Carlile, a printer, for
      publishing an edition of Paine's Age of Reason, in conjunction with the
      self-styled Society for the Suppression of Vice, I take the liberty to
      submit to your consideration a few remarks, upon the nature and tendency
      of this purposed suit. Since prosecutions of this kind are not novel, and
      as it may be fairly conjectured that you will follow the ordinary routine
      of men in your office in these causes, and moreover as the accused will be
      subjected to the usual disadvantage of meeting three pleadings to the one
      which will be allowed him, besides the probable interruptions from the
      Judge on the bench, I think it needful and reasonable to anticipate and
      meet beforehand those hacknied arguments, which it seems to me most
      probable that you will advance in the court on the days of trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the accuser should be permitted to plead three times to the once with
      which the accused is but imperfectly indulged, though it may be law, is
      most flagrant injustice. But, perhaps, you may not be quite satisfied with
      my arithmetic, and may ask me, how I make out my three pleadings to one.
      It were much to the honour of this country, and its laws, if I should be
      mistaken in my calculation, but I fear to be put to the blush as an
      Englishman, (if you serjeants at law are not,) by my computation, being
      found to be but too true.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, you open the case. This you do not reckon pleading:
      but as you are allowed to say whatever you think proper, it becomes as
      truly a pleading in reality as your latter speech, which alone you call by
      that name. The second is what is styled so on both sides. And this would
      be injustice, if I stopped here; but having engaged to reckon up three
      pleadings, I fix upon the most unfit person that could be named; that is,
      my Lord Judge, to plead on the third occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech of the Judge, you crown-lawyers term summing up the evidence;
      but I believe you can never adduce one solitary instance in a crown
      prosecution, in which the Judge has not acted completely the part of a
      retained counsel for the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      That my Lord Judge should be unable to divest himself of the habit of
      pleading as an advocate, since he has formerly followed that employment,
      though far from equitable or decorous, is still very natural, like as the
      mail-coach horse which has aforetime been a hunter,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "When hounds and horns the forest rend,"
</pre>
    <p>
      pricks up his ears, and longs to join in the pursuit. But the Judge also
      discharges a still more exceptionable office, that of interrupter on the
      part of the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is apt to lug in his observation, that what the accused is saying in
      his own defence is <i>irrelevant</i> to the question; though a man's
      penetration must be astonishing who can determine beforehand that any
      particular sentence uttered shall not, by a concatenation of argument, be
      brought to bear forcibly upon the point in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the accused adduces instances of opposite decisions in similar
      proceeding suits, with a view to point out an inconsistency, the Judge
      will exclaim, "That is not the cause before us;" though how in the world
      can inconsistency be shewn without bringing forward more than one
      particular?
    </p>
    <p>
      These ill-timed interruptions, by breaking the thread of connection of the
      defence of the accused, must so maul it, and put it out of shape, that the
      jury become unable to make either head or tail of it, even though it
      should have been previously drawn up with good judgement, and contain the
      soundest reasonings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In trials for alledged blasphemy, if the accused complains that a garbled
      extract made from his book does not convey its true sense, and wishes to
      read it at large, the court object, and cry out, that the book is too bad
      to be read in that place, and that it will poison the ears of the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the accused desires that the Bible may be referred to, in proof of its
      contradictions or blameable passages, the court bawls aloud that it is too
      good a book to be produced before the profane. If reference be thus
      objected to, by what means, then, shall the truth be brought to light?
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Mr. Attorney-General, let us proceed to your own probable
      allegations and arguments in court in this particular cause; and I will
      suppose you to say to the gentlemen of the jury, that you have been urged
      by the representations of a respectable body of men, the Society for the
      Suppression of Vice, to prosecute R. Carlile, whom you have discovered and
      proved before the court to have gone <i>vi et armis</i>, by violence and
      with weapons of war, and not having the fear of God before his eyes, to
      have published a blasphemous libel, the Age of Reason, by Thomas Paine,
      which libel had been previously condemned by a Jury, and burnt by the
      common hangman. That the wicked tendency of this libel was to induce a
      general disbelief of your and their most holy religion, that pure,
      pacific, and benevolent system, which, having emanated from the Deity, is,
      to its adherents, the basis of their comforts in this life, their solace
      in the hours of affliction, sickness, and death, their moral instruction
      in this world, and their providitor of everlasting happiness in a world to
      come; that libels of this impious description were with a malignant zeal
      thrown in the way of the young and inexperienced, too undiscerning to
      detect their sophistry, or suspect the poison contained in them, and too
      ignorant yet of the world to be on their guard against the practices of
      bad men: that irreligion and; immorality are necessarily connected; and
      that the propagators of infidelity are actuated by a malice too virulent
      to be attributed to mere human passion, and for which a motive and
      stimulus would be in vain sought for, unless it be assigned to the
      instigators of the great enemy of mankind, the Devil. The jury will be
      conjured, as they value the preservation of good morals, the peace and
      good order of society, both individual and public welfare, the happiness
      of their fellow-subjects both in this world and in a future life, to
      arrest the fatal poison in its progress, and give a verdict of conviction
      and condemnation against the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Mr. Attorney General, you would not take shining pinchbeck counters
      instead of sovereigns for a fee, with as little close examination as you
      will wish the jury to admit the weight and validity of your arguments, and
      the accuracy of your assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imposing name assumed by the Society who are the ostensible movers of
      the prosecution, might, at the first glance, seem sufficient to carry all
      before it, and to dispatch the business at one blow. For what could such a
      Society direct their efforts, against but vice? However, men are not to be
      judged of by the titles they choose to give to themselves, without some
      scrutiny being made into their conduct. This self styled Society for the
      Suppression of Vice, exhibit themselves to us as the foes to free inquiry,
      and stifling the arguments on one side of a question. In vain will they
      excuse themselves as preventing the poisonous effects of reasonings on the
      wrong side; for to decide in that way which side is wrong is a <i>petitio
      propositi</i>, a begging of the question. Real truth is best established
      by the free production of the arguments on both sides; for thereby
      suspicion of unfairness is re moved. So many absurdities attend upon error
      and falsehood, that truth has a very preponderating advantage against
      them, where enquiry is left free. The arguments then adduced on the wrong
      side of a question, are not so noxious and poisonous as disingenuous men
      wish to insinuate. The truth abhors to be indebted to suppression of
      argument, from that it never can derive advantage; therefore it is only
      resorted to by the party who are in the wrong. This endeavour to suppress
      argument implies disingenuousness, and this last named quality is always
      at variance with real truth. Error may be designed, but disingenuousness
      never can be; and, therefore, when accompanied with violence, it is always
      criminal. Disinenuousness, as far as it extends, cannot consist with the
      love of truth, but error may. Now as the love of truth is the basis of all
      real morality, this disingenuous self-styled Society for the Suppression
      of Vice, are, therefore, detected to be a Society for the Suppression of
      Virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will still suppose you to proceed in the beaten, track of your
      predecessors in office, and omitting to reply to the technicality <i>vi et
      armis</i>, on which, I imagine, you lay no stress, I take the liberty to
      question the propriety of the accustomed phrase, "not having the fear of
      God before his eyes." You will admit, Mr. Attorney-General, that to forge
      the Great Seal of England would be a criminal deception, and also, that to
      examine whether it was forged or not, or to state reasons for believing it
      to have been forged, would be allowable. Now, as the authority of the
      Creator is a higher one than the British Government, so to forge a
      revelation from him would be a more criminal imposture than the former
      one; and a rigid examination and scrutiny into its truth or falsehood, and
      all doubts and rational exceptions against a supposed revelation, would
      always be innocent, and might sometimes be laudable. Therefore, as Paine's
      Age of Reason is an objection against the truth of the supposed
      revelations of Moses and Jesus, the conduct of R. Carlile in publishing it
      must be innocent, at least, if not meritorious, and therefore would
      consist well with a pious veneration towards the Supreme Being; and this
      invalidates your assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which libel had been condemned by the legislature." But as the
      legislature is composed of fallible men, their sanction does not prove the
      truth and validity of Jesus's pretensions; and as the conduct of the
      legislature in sanctioning this revelation might be directed and
      influenced by political motives, their sanction is an argument rather
      against than in favour of its truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And burnt by the common hangman." Jean Jaques Rousseau says, and so must
      every reasonable man, <i>Bruler un livre n'est pas y repondre</i>,
      "Burning a book is not answering it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wicked tendency of this libel was to induce a general disbelief of
      your and their most holy religion." The truth can only be ascertained by
      leaving inquiry free, that arguments on both, sides of a question may be
      brought forward, in order that it may be seen on which side the
      preponderance lies. Therefore, the same objection would hold good against
      producing the arguments on the wrong side of any other question, as well
      as this before us now; this would militate against truth in general, and
      is, of course, absurd. Besides, as the Deists have made the offer to argue
      with Jesus's followers upon the truth or falsehood of Jesus's pretensions
      upon fair and equal terms, which offer Jesus's followers have thought
      proper to divine, therefore, to use a figure borrowed from pugilistic
      combats, the Deists throw up the hat and claim the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That pure, pacific, and benevolent system, which having emanated from the
      Deity." But the Deists offer to bring arguments to disprove the purity,
      peaceableness, and benevolence of Jesus's system, and likewise its origin
      from the Supreme Being; and your laws hinder those arguments from
      appearing. Now, this endeavour of yours to suppress is concealment. And if
      there is nothing criminal in this system of Jesus, what could you have to
      conceal? The Deists do not endeavour to conceal any thing, it is the
      hiding, hushing, concealing party which are the guilty; where morality is
      concerned concealment implies guilt. If the Deists venture to bring
      forward demonstrations from the four Gospels against the personal moral
      character of Jesus, you call that blasphemy. But recollect, that when the
      Deists make you the offer to discuss the moral character and the
      pretensions of Jesus to a mission from the Almighty upon honourable and
      fair terms, and you choose to decline this equitable proposal, the charge
      of blasphemy falls upon yourselves; your sneaking evasion and concealment
      cause the charge of blasphemy to be brought home against you, and you
      stand convicted yourselves as the blasphemers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is to its adherents the basis of their comforts in this life." Observe,
      that those very men who lay heavy taxation upon this country, and, what
      was unknown to Pagan times, entail those taxes upon unborn children, those
      men are among the most zealous asserters of Jesus's pretensions, and
      employ Jesus's priests as diligent advocates for the imposition of public
      burdens on the land, and sundry abuses. So that the bulk of the people of
      this country are not much indebted to Jesus's system for temporal
      comforts. Nay, it rather deprives them of many comforts, and even
      necessaries in this life. We have such men at present in office, of
      greatest power and trust, who are of such principles that they would
      countenance and patronize no religion but what suited their purpose, and
      promoted their tyranny and oppressive objects and designs. Therefore, we
      may see what Jesus's religion is by its suiting them so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their solace in the hours of affliction, sickness, and death." Jesus's
      religion has caused the affliction and death of far more people than it
      has solaced on such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their moral instructor in this world." The real moral tendency of Jesus's
      system is one of the points at issue between his followers and the Deists;
      therefore that position is not to be assumed as it has not been fairly
      proved. The effect of Jesus's religion may have been to repress some vices
      in the world, but it has greatly increased others. When the Pagan Romans
      possessed Britain, there was not as much gin, brandy, and whiskey drank
      here as there is now. Nay, the Pagan Romans used to mix water with their
      wine most usually. Unpaid Bank notes were unknown to them; and thus
      millions of inhabitants were not employed in circulating among themselves
      falsehood and fraud, which horrid practice among us renders those two last
      crimes familiar to the view, and abates the abhorrence of them. Indeed,
      perjury was evidently not near so frequent among the Pagan Romans as it is
      now that Jesus's system has prevailed; this fact we can clearly infer from
      what remains to us of Greek and Roman writers. The unnatural tax on unborn
      children was totally unknown to those ancients: so that Jesus's morality
      has not done us much good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And their providitor of everlasting happiness in a world to come." There
      are some drawbacks in this world, at any rate, if we reckon the Sunday's
      weekly gloom, and the tythes on all landed property. Whether this future
      happiness be attained to at last or not by Jesus's followers, it is a
      long, a very melancholy road, however, that they go to it. And as a tenth
      levied on all landed produce and other church dues are pretty large,
      payment in advance for an inheritance in an unseen country, which no man
      living has visited, it seems unreasonable for the law to hinder a scrutiny
      and examination into the validity of the title-deeds. Besides, as the land
      is rated heavier than other property, the payment falls very unequally on
      the holders of shares in this <i>Terra Incognita</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Libels of this impious description are zealously thrown in the way of the
      young and inexperienced." This practising upon the minds of the young and
      inexperienced, if it be culpable, is not so chargeable upon the Deists as
      upon Jesus's priests. The deistical writings are argumentative, and
      therefore cannot be read by the young till they are almost grown up, and
      the judgement is always appealed to by the Deists; neither do they
      discourage the examination of the other side of the question, as Jesus's
      followers usually do. On the other hand, Jesus's priests burden the memory
      of children, not seven years old, with creeds and catechisms; besides,
      they labour to prejudice the young in favour of Jesus's system, and to
      discourage all fair inquiry into what concerns its truth; a conduct which
      the Deists would abhor to pursue in favour of deism. Moreover, the
      catechisms and other machinations of Jesus's priests are calculated to
      impair the discerning faculty of the young, and to blunt its acumen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us examine the beginning of the church of England catechism as an
      example. "Q. Who gave you that name?"&mdash;"A. My godfathers and
      godmothers in my baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ," &amp;c.
      How should a child at seven years comprehend the meaning of a membership
      with an unseen metaphysical being? This beginning with children on
      subjects beyond their comprehension is playing tricks with their
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Q. What did your godfathers, &amp;c. then for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A. They did promise and vow three things in my name: first, that I should
      renounce the devil and all his works." It is a monstrous proposition to
      instil into a child's mind that one person could swear to the certainty of
      another's conduct. Surely these priestly tricks must be meant to
      incapacitate these young children throughout life from thinking ever
      acutely on religious subjects. And what idea could a child have of the
      devil's works? Of the devil himself they might form some notion from the
      picture of him, and might
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Dream of the devil, and wake in a fright."
</pre>
    <p>
      The processions [i. e. pomps] and empty things of this wicked world. Would
      any pious man swear that a child should not be fond of processions, pomps,
      and splendid shows? Neither could a child distinguish empty things or
      vanities of the world. It is unavailing for Jesus's priests to say that at
      any age of maturity these distinctions will be comprehended, for they have
      taken care before hand, as far as they could, to injure and debilitate the
      discerning faculty: and if they should afterwards distinguish vanities,
      they would still be less able to examine religious truths; and to place
      impediments in the way of this last, is the priest's object. "Secondly,
      that I should believe all the articles of the Christian faith." How can
      one person swear, to what another shall believe? and what a notion this
      swearing must give to young minds of the reverence due to an oath!
      Descant, Mr. Attorney-General, as you think proper upon the good moral
      tendency of the religion as by law established, but you will find it very
      difficult to prove your assertions in its favour, whenever you may please
      to advance them. The oath extends so far as that the child shall believe
      not one article only but all the articles of Jesus's religion, and that
      without even comprehending them all, for some, as that of the Trinity, are
      quite unintelligible; and some of these articles contain other articles so
      as to embrace the whole volume of the Bible, all and singular every
      passage of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And thirdly, that I should keep God's holy will and commandments." Then
      they must swear that the boy shall never be a godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is done to impair the intellect, and accounts, in part, for the
      extreme obstinacy and prejudice of Jesus's followers. Somebody must have
      sworn, Mr. Attorney General, that you should never be an Attorney-General;
      for this exercise of your office herein described, is not compatible with
      much scrupulosity. As for its being said that the child afterwards takes
      the oath upon itself, oaths cannot be so transferred; therefore that plea
      is futile. No description of people, besides Jesus's followers, ever
      admitted the execrable principle of the transfer of an oath. In fact, if
      the godfathers had sworn that the boy should turn out a pickle, after all
      the rest of priestly management, they would have stood a pretty good
      chance of having nothing fall upon their conscience from that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus's priests are apt to injure the intellect of young people by telling
      them, that if they do not believe Jesus's religion they will be damned to
      eternal punishments. Now as in all natural belief, when the intellect is
      sound and healthy, the mind is always passive in the act of giving its
      assent to any proposition, this trick of Jesus's priests disturbs,
      impairs, and disorders the understanding; and by this means also people
      are rendered incapable, throughout life, to reason and inquire with
      penetration, discernment, and impartiality on religious subjects. The
      natural belief of a sound mind is not determined by the will. If men
      could, in all cases, believe whatever they pleased, their minds would be a
      complete chaos; yet have Jesus's priests, in all ages since the days of
      the founder of their religion, offered this violence to the human
      intellect. Thus, I think, that I have shewn you, Mr. Attorney-General,
      that the young and inexperienced are not more in danger of imbibing absurd
      notions and depraved principles from the Deists than from Jesus's priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now proceed to examine a supposed assertion, rife enough among those of
      your side of the question that "infidelity and immorality are necessarily
      connected." That the Deists and other unbelievers are more immoral than
      Jesus's followers, is more than can be proved. And when we consider that
      Jesus's religion is always taken up as a prejudice, and is maintained in
      the world by violence, and by a pertinacious determination of Jesus's
      adherents to hear the reasons only on one side of the question, that side
      which is favourable to his pretensions, a procedure which is utterly
      repugnant to the love of truth, the most probable conjecture is, that the
      unbelievers should be, upon the whole, the more moral party. But it must
      be allowed to be a difficult matter to determine such a question as that
      to any thing like certainty. Until it be determined, however, you have no
      right to make the assertion alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you declaim upon the too great prevalence of infidelity, you speak a
      language which implies the insane and monstrous notion that natural belief
      is dependent upon the will; whereas it is the known and suggested reasons
      which always naturally determine the assent. A man is no more culpable
      merely for what he believes, than he is for discovering by the taste that
      sugar is sweet and aloes bitter. Your slang when you speak of infidelity
      and belief, as virtues or vices, reprehensible or laudable, would be quite
      unintelligible to us, if we were not already acquainted with the tricks
      and machinations of priests to create prejudice, or frighten people into
      an assent to points, which they dare not trust and submit to the test of
      fair inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Creator were to require an assent without a sufficient reason to
      determine it, he would demand what is contrary to the structure of the
      human mind, which was formed by himself: thus he would disorder his own
      work, which is a thing incredible. If he has suggested reasons which would
      not have been otherwise thought of, let Jesus's priests produce them, and
      let them be examined. Then the prosecutions of Deists would be
      superfluous, for they would be forced to: believe when the reasons were
      found cogent enough. But no such reasons have been hitherto produced:
      reason or no reason, the assent is still required. And how shall such an
      assent without reasons sufficient be distinguished from what is
      universally allowed, by physicians and all others, to be insanity and
      mental derangement?
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the propagators of infidelity are instigated by the Devil." This
      assertion, very usual from men in your office, Mr. Attorney-General, you
      are unable to prove. And hereby you remind us, that Jesus's followers
      universally admit the very absurd notion of two principles in the
      universe, a good and a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that the moderns being ashamed of it, wish to abrogate it, and to
      throw it off from themselves upon the early heretics. But we shall not
      allow you to escape that way. If you advance any principle, you must admit
      all the consequences which necessarily flow from it; and we will not
      suffer your evasions in this particular. When pressed hard, you followers
      of Jesus want to pass off the Devil upon us for a mere angel, and tell us
      of his war in Heaven, and that he was cast out upon the earth. This will
      not do, we shall not allow you this subterfuge, for in other places your
      received canon of Scripture maintains the ubiquity of the Devil; this
      extravagant notion with which we charge you, we shall bring home to you.
      In 2 Cor. chap. iv. ver. 4, you have, "In whom the God of this world hath
      blinded the eyes of them that believe not." implying, that the Devil, i.
      e. the God of this world, is present in all unbelievers. This is still
      further confirmed by 1 John chap. v. ver. 19, "The whole world lieth in
      the wicked one," i.e. the Devil. I know that it is translated, "lieth in
      wickedness." But this is a sneaking evasion of Jesus's followers, who are
      ashamed of the notion of the two principles. That is an extraordinary
      vicious translation of the passage. A man who knows the least of Greek at
      all must be sensible that the passage will only admit of the rendering
      which I have here, and others have before me, given to it. The Devil is
      said by Jesus's followers to pervade the whole unbelieving world. If you
      complain, Mr. Attorney-General, that this is pressing a lawyer too far on
      a theological question, I shall lay the blame on you, and those who have
      held your office, for starting this particular subject; and whenever an
      Attorney-General advances a position he takes the risks attending it. The
      story of the Devil's fall from Heaven in Revelations, chap. xii. may
      establish and show an inconsistency in Jesus's religion, but it does not
      get you nor his followers clear of the silly notion of the two principles,
      when your canon of Scripture has once advanced what clearly implies that
      groundless notion.

      "The jury are conjured." Since the detection and exposition of that
      infamous list of jurors, out of which a jury used to be packed for the
      Crown whenever it was prosecutor, some sort of reformation has taken place
      in the manner of appointing a jury, so as to leave a better chance of
      having disinterested men on the jury. Before Hone's trial the scene which
      used to take place in prosecutions for alledged blasphemy was scandalous
      and detestable. The legislature take upon themselves to assign a
      revelation to the Almighty, but as a revelation is a delineation of his
      character, they assign to him a character of their own choosing; and as
      they labour to suppress and hide the objections started against it, that
      character which they have given to the Supreme Being must of course be a
      bad one, because concealment in this case implies guilt in the concealing
      party: so that the charge of blasphemy is justly retorted upon the
      legislature and upon the prosecuting party in this case of R. Carlile, and
      also in the preceding cases of Houston, the reputed author of Ecce Homo,
      of Williams, who was
    </p>
    <p>
      Paine's printer of the Age of Reason, of Daniel Isaac Eaton, too, and
      others. The legislative bodies, I repeat, and their accomplices, are the
      real blaspheming party, who have given, as they testify by their
      concealing practices, a bad and slanderous character to the Almighty, and
      whose guilt is aggravated by their endeavours to hinder other men from
      vindicating him from their foul aspersions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury on all those above-mentioned occasions invariably gave up the
      character of the Maker of the universe to be traduced and calumniated by
      the legislative bodies and their accomplices; and this abandonment of all
      rectitude and decency was by bad men termed a verdict, i. e. <i>a vere
      dictum</i>, whereby infallibility was attributed to twelve mortal men at
      the same time that it was denied to the Ancient of Days, the real
      proprietor of all worlds. If persons, sitting judiciously upon the
      character of this exalted Being, gave it up thus to be reviled, they
      ought, at least, to have been Gods whose judgement was to have been thus
      appealed to; in fact, this sort of appeal of the prosecuting party to
      twelve mortals was erecting them to something far above the human nature;
      and these twelve mortals were induced by a gratuity of one or more guineas
      a piece, a good dinner, with plenty of jovial nectar, at the expence of
      the country, to consign over the character of the Almighty to reviling and
      insult, thereby opening a door for a supposititious system of morality,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "And raised to gods confess even virtue vain."
     &mdash;Pope.
</pre>
    <p>
      "As they value the preservation of good morals." This, as I have shewn,
      must be merely ironical, these prosecutions having the opposite tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The peace and good order of society." This is to obtain a submission to
      tyranny; which submission Jesus in his religion inculcates by his Apostle
      Peter, 1 Cph. chap. ii. ver. 13: "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of
      man." And this will account for zeal of the ruling authorities to support
      Jesus's pretensions:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Individual and public welfare." This, after what has been shewn, must be
      all rant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The happiness of their fellow-subjects here and hereafter." This can
      never be promoted by suppressing argument and stifling inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrest the fatal poison." Here the fair and free investigation and
      examination of propositions is called poison. Yet, who but the wicked can
      have any thing to dread from inquiry?
    </p>
    <p>
      I apprehend, Mr. Shepherd, that you and the self' styled Society for the
      Suppression of Vice carry on separate prosecutions, but I have classed you
      both together, because you are both of you aiding, abetting, and assisting
      in the same design. Of what individuals that Society is composed is not
      known to me, but as the Bishops of Durham and Rochester are the
      presidents, I conclude, that many priests of Jesus are among the number,
      and that, at any rate, the parsons are the chief instructors in this
      business. That free inquiry should not generally take place is much their
      interest, for thereby their "gains would be gone." They would much wish
      that the ignorance of ancient days, so profitable to parsons, could be
      brought back; and I send you a verse or two upon a desire expressed in the
      Gentleman's, or as it ought to be called, from its treating so much of
      ecclesiastical matters, and expressing the wish of the parsons, the
      Parson's Magazine, that the level near St. Andrew's church should be
      filled up.

    <p>
      The self-styled Society for the Suppression of Vice, are zealous to
      substitute useless or absurd observances as parts of religion, instead of
      real true morality; and have taken great pains to prevent amusements, and
      produce a gloom throughout Sunday, the only holiday for many people. There
      are not less spirits drank on amount of a sabbatical gloom; for harmless
      chearfulness is rather a preservative of innocence. I have therefore sent
      you, Mr. Attorney-General, a song, which I beg you to deliver to the
      parsons of that Society, and to any other parsons, to help them to keep up
      their spirits.

    <h2>
      LETTER TO MR. CARLILE,
    </h2>
    <h3>
      London, 28th February, 1819.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      You are about to be placed in a situation, and to perform a part, which
      will interweave your name in the page of history:&mdash;not, however, in
      that species of history which records the wars, bloodshed, or misery of
      nations, as opposed to one another; but in that which exhibits the
      cruelties of governments towards individuals among their own subjects, who
      seeing, or thinking they see, their fellow men suffering afflictions
      through the ignorance, prejudice, and misrule of their governments,
      endeavour to remove the causes of such oppressions and misery, by
      disclosing them, and setting their fellow-men to think for themselves. You
      have had the virtue and intrepidity to engage in this honourable career,
      and are, consequently, a prominent object in the public eye. Every friend
      to the progress of knowledge, reason, and truth, as well as of sincere
      humanity, is warmly interested in the nature and result of those severe
      proceedings instituted against you. They devoutly hope that your character
      as a man and a neighbour will afford no handle for disparagement of you
      and your conduct; that your moral principles are good, and your integrity
      unquestioned; that your deportment in the relations of private and
      domestic life is amiable: and that conscious of the purity of your
      motives, you will not shrink before the threats of your adversaries; but,
      on the contrary, display that manly firmness of courage which will enable
      you to encounter and defeat the numerical, though not formidable,
      superiority of force to be arrayed against you. If, however, contrary to
      our hopes and expectations, the abettors of persecution in church and
      state should, by their arts and machinations, succeed in obtaining a
      verdict for the persecutor, be you assured that the respect, sympathy, and
      support of every enlightened, liberal, and benevolent mind, will follow
      you, wherever your oppressors may convey your person. Yet, I cannot but
      cherish anticipations of a very different termination of these
      proceedings, engendered as they are between religious bigotry and
      political folly, when submitted by both sides to a jury of our countrymen.
      I trust that impartial justice will guide their decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a friend to the universal freedom of mankind, civil and religious, I
      take leave to address you, for the purpose of contributing my sincere
      congratulations on the honours that await you, and the fine opportunity
      presented to you of benefiting mankind. I regret that the nature of my
      situation constrains me to conceal my name. To disclose it would, in all
      probability, prove my ruin in worldly circumstances, and thus both my
      present and future usefulness in this very cause be destroyed. I know many
      individuals, eminent for public and private virtue, who entertain the same
      sentiments as myself, who, by the prejudices so assiduously kept up, are
      equally obliged to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have felt desirous, too, of sending you a few unconnected thoughts which
      have occurred to me on your case. It is very likely that they are quite
      common, and may have been much better expressed by others; yet,
      nevertheless, I shall state them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can easily suppose, that, even if you had an intention to employ counsel
      in your defence, you would find some difficulty, in the present servility
      of the bar to the powers that be, to obtain any assistance. But you
      require none, and you will be your own best advocate. I am not a lawyer,
      and therefore am I neither deeply read in musty statutes, nor skilled in
      legal subtleties. I apprehend, however, that there is not a law in the
      statute book forbidding theological controversy. The crime with which you
      are charged is called a <i>libel</i>. Now, what a libel is I do not know,
      nor can any body tell me; yet you are doubtless pretty well aware, that
      your prosecutors will, in a strain of inflated declamation and bombast,
      describe this libel as a thing of the most atrocious and diabolical nature
      and tendency. Your mode of defence against this attack is obvious. Since
      the question at issue between you and your accusers is not one of law, but
      of fact, your object is to get behind their ambuscade of words, and beat
      down their phillippics by that irresistible weapon, common sense, wielded
      by an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always appeared to my understanding that the most powerful argument
      that can be used with well-meaning people who assisted in, or approve of,
      prosecutions to support the ascendancy of their religion, is, that which
      shews such prosecutions to have a <i>directly opposite tendency</i>.
      Persecution is the very scandal of religion: it confesses weakness at
      once, and is a complete admission that the origin, doctrines, and progress
      of that religion cannot bear investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proves that the professors of and believers in it, are not themselves
      convinced of its truth and divine nature. But a system of things being
      established, of which these persons form apart, in which they live, move,
      and have their being, <i>they wish it to be true</i>. They themselves take
      it for granted, and live very comfortably under that system of machinery
      of which it is a wheel, and so their interest and indolence combine in
      prompting them to wish every one else to have the same belief. There are
      people, however, who cannot, and will not, believe what appears to their
      judgements to be false; but, should they go farther than this, and
      consciously wishing their fellow-creatures to perceive the truth,
      endeavour to shew by writings on what grounds they cannot, and others
      ought not, to believe in falsehood and impositions, then, in default of
      counter argument, or refutation by the same instrument of reason, courts
      of law and armed authority are called on, <i>to compel</i> those
      unbelievers either to believe, and of course such belief would be against
      their consciences, or to hold their tongues. In former ages, shooting,
      stabbing, burning, and flaying alive, were the means used for propagating
      religion for the good of men's souls; now they are imprisonment, fine,
      pillory: but these remnants of barbarity are also fast sinking into
      disgrace and disuse, and I cannot help thinking that you are destined to
      give the finishing blow, in this country at least, to the cruelties of
      bigotry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as inspiration or direct revelation from Heaven is not believed even
      by Christians (at least the more rational) of this day, though in the
      early and middle ages of Christianity priests and monks would have sworn
      that God communicated with them every day, let me suggest that, in the
      course of your defence, you ask the Jury trying your guilt or innocence as
      a <i>libeller</i> of that religion, whether <i>they</i> believe it to be
      founded on <i>truth?</i> And since it would be to insult them, you can
      add, to suppose they should profess belief of a subject doubtless
      considered by them of the highest importance to their present and future
      welfare, without having thoroughly examined it, again ask&mdash;whether in
      their hearts and consciences they think that any sophistical reasoning,
      which every thing contrary to it they must deem so, could shake their
      principles thus established on the basis of demonstration? If so
      established, what can hurt it&mdash;what can be a libel on it? Unless
      their religion be capable of <i>demonstration</i>, it is at best but <i>doubtful</i>,
      and may, therefore, be at least <i>susceptible</i> of confutation. If, in
      spite of the objections and attacks to which it has been exposed, it can
      be shewn to be the true religion after all, such discussion, instead of
      doing harm, must do good, inasmuch as it fixes the religion on a firmer
      basis. On a subject where so many men of the most acute intellect and most
      respectable character differ in opinion, you, as a humble inquirer after
      truth, may be allowed to have yours. Speculative opinions on religion, you
      can tell the jury, are nothing: whether you are a Roman Catholic, a
      Protestant, a Mohammedan, a worshipper of Vishnu, or a Free Thinker, or
      none of all these, is of no consequence to mankind, either governing or
      governed&mdash;It is a matter between you and your Maker only. All that
      governments can have to do with individuals, is their conduct as members
      of the state towards their neighbours. Had you been charged with any acts
      of disturbance, with the violation of any of the laws for the protection
      of persons and property, then it would have been intelligible; you might
      have been a fit object for trial, and, if found guilty, of punishment. Not
      one of the books which you have published have the slightest tendency to
      promote disorder, but, on the contrary do they profess and are calculated
      by a diffusion of their principes to extend and consolidate universal
      peace, virtue, happiness, and prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, then, the gentlemen of the Jury's religion be founded on what they
      have satisfied their understanding to be <i>truth</i>, nothing can injure
      it; since, if it really come from God, to imagine that any writings,
      whether argumentative or satirical, could maintain a doubtful contest with
      books said to contain a revelation of the divine will, is actually to
      raise the author of such writings, and you their publisher, to a level
      with God himself! or, rather, to degrade that Almighty, wise, and good
      Being, your Creator, to a level with you, the creature. Hence it follows,
      that persecution may destroy, but never can support any religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot have a better ground-work for your defence than the theological
      works of Paine, which, indeed, settle the question about the inspiration
      of the scriptures and the divinity of Christ. On the subject of religion
      generally there is a book which every lover of truth must regret is not so
      well known as it will infallibly be in no long time&mdash;I allude to a
      work entitled "Principles of Morality," by George Ensor, Esq. It displays
      the most extensive research and erudition, combined with good sense and an
      amiable disposition; the subject is pursued with much perspicuity of
      order, and expressed in an easy, neat, appropriate style. The book forms a
      very useful companion to Hume's ingenious and philosophical Essays on the
      Natural History of Religion.

      I have now to advert to what you will doubtless consider the most valuable
      part of this communication. At the period of the late Mr. Eaton's cruel
      and abominable treatment under the chief persecutorship of Lord
      Ellenborough and his high priest, Sir Vicary Gibbs, a letter appeared in
      the Morning Chronicle on the subject of that unfortunate gentleman's
      unmerited punishment. It purported to be written by one who believed in
      the Christian religion; but it evinced sentiments so liberal, reasoning so
      just and forcible; it placed the right of conscience, even as good policy,
      in so striking a point of view; arguing the subject in such good temper,
      and with such conciseness, as to appear to me a masterpiece of its kind,
      and a standard to which every member of the Christian church ought to be
      referred. I preserved a copy of it at the time, and now send you one
      transcribed, believing that it may be useful to you, or that it may at
      least be interesting to you in the perusal.

      The public mind has, of late years, been making rapid progress towards a
      true knowledge of its rights. Priestcraft and bigotry must and will be
      destroyed. Once trampled upon by man in the energy of his wrath, these
      monsters can never again rear their Gorgon heads. Like the Apollo
      represented by the Grecian sculptor, in the act of destroying the Pythian
      serpent, man will then stand as God created him, the impress of his own
      image, erect, free, noble, and grand. We have seen the glorious result of
      the attempt to crush, not Hone, but in him the spirit of a free press, and
      it is not permitted us to doubt that a similar triumph and reward awaits
      you.

      To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      I was one of those who saw Mr. Eaton stand in the pillory for what has
      been called an attempt to overturn the religion of his country. The manner
      in which the spectators behaved during the execution of this severe
      punishment, was, in my opinion, highly creditable to the liberality of the
      age. I think I may venture to say, there was hardly an individual present
      who did not sympathise with the unfortunate man; he was cheered by numbers
      during the whole time of the punishment; and many efforts were made to
      convey various kinds of refreshments to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one of those who wish well to the interests of the Christian religion,
      I own I was shocked upon this occasion. I have always conceived this
      religion to be perfectly independent of the arm of authority for its
      support, and to require only to be heard and examined to bear down every
      species of opposition. I cannot but consider that it has made its way
      against power, learning, and philosophy, united to destroy it; nor can I
      refuse to draw from this the deduction, that it will equally withstand all
      the efforts of abuse, sophistry, and calumny. When I see any set of men
      resort to punishment, instead of argument, in its defence, I can with
      difficulty conceive they are serious in the belief of its doctrines, for
      the smallest reflection might convince them, that such a course is the
      most effectual method they could take to lower its estimation, and to
      cover it with discredit. It betrays that diffidence and fear for the
      result which a man thoroughly impressed with the truth of the Christian
      doctrines would surely not be the most likely to entertain. I cannot bring
      myself, therefore, to believe, that those who manifest a zeal to crush the
      enemies of Christianity by the arm of the law, are themselves acquainted
      with that religion. I imagine them, on the contrary, to be men whose time
      and attention have been completely ingrossed by secular affairs, and who
      believe the Christian religion as they would believe the Mohammedan,
      merely because their fathers believed it before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let those cruel persecutors reflect for a moment on the injury they are
      thus doing to the very cause they are pretending to support. Let them
      consider that religion can be defended only by argument, or by force; and
      that it cannot be defended by the union of both; for it is in vain to say,
      it may be defended by argument, when the reasonings on one side only can
      be heard aloud, while those on the other draw down on the head of the user
      of them pillory and imprisonment. It is certainly a very unequal conflict
      when one of the combatants may make use of an argument or a halter at his
      discretion. It is like a battle between a pugilist and one armed with a
      stiletto, which, though he may not use at first, he knows he can use if
      hard pushed. Such defenders of Christianity would do well to remember,
      that the means they are resorting to are those which so successfully
      promoted the cause of infidelity in France. Had the same pains been
      bestowed in refuting the productions of Rousseau, Diderot, and Voltaire,
      which were employed in burning their books and punishing the authors,
      France and the whole of Europe might, at this day, have exhibited very
      different spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of liberal opinion has been very rapid, indeed, of late
      years; and though Judges and Attorney-Generals, whose daily pursuits,
      certainly so unfavourable to liberal and comprehensive reasonings, are
      generally among the last persons to shake off antiquated prejudices, yet
      they too, however slowly, will, unquestionably, at last, be borne down by
      the tide of public opinion.
